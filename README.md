The code is comprised in two files.

1. ./generate_patterns : This generates the patterns for the different nested loop scenarios asked in the problem text.
2. ./buffer_manager : It takes as input the access patterns as generated by above and runs them using LRU or MRU on a specified pagetable size and counts the number of page faults.

All addresses are assumed to be 1-indexed.
Format of patterns file: 
<<Number of accesses(N)>> <<Max Buffer Address>>
<A1> <A2> ... <AN>

Help:

    Usage: ./generate_patterns <<inner_table>> <<outer_table>>
    tables are specified as employee -> 0 , department -> 1, project -> 2
    Usage: ./buffer_manager <<POLICY>> <<TABLE_SIZE>> 
    POLICY=> LRU->0, MRU->1
